Hive Empire - Incremental Strategy Prototype

[SHORT DESCRIPTION - 140 characters]
Build an automated pollen network. Manage a global bee fleet. Adapt to seasonal changes. Maximize income in this incremental strategy prototype.

[MAIN DESCRIPTION]

🐝 ABOUT HIVE EMPIRE

Hive Empire is an incremental strategy game where you build and optimize an automated pollen delivery network. Manage a limited pool of bees, unlock new biome regions, and craft valuable honey recipes as you race against a 21-week seasonal campaign.

This is a portfolio prototype showcasing clean systems architecture, data-driven design, and event-based UI patterns.


🎮 GAMEPLAY

• UNLOCK biome regions to access unique pollen types (Forest, Plains, Mountain, Desert, Coastal, Tundra)
• ALLOCATE bees from a global pool to competing flower patches
• AUTOMATE pollen collection - bees continuously gather and deliver to your hive
• PRODUCE honey recipes automatically when ingredients are available
• OPTIMIZE production chains to maximize income before winter arrives


⚡ KEY FEATURES

STRATEGIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
• Global bee fleet system - allocate limited bees across multiple regions
• Real-time production rate indicators show bottlenecks (green = surplus, red = shortage)
• Capacity upgrades unlock more bee slots per region
• Priority-based recipe production for advanced optimization

SEASONAL CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE
• 21-week year divided into 3 seasons (Spring → Summer → Autumn)
• Dynamic seasonal modifiers affect income, bee speed, and production time
• Adapt your strategy as conditions change each season
• End-of-year summary with statistics and high score tracking

SATISFYING AUTOMATION
• Watch your network operate without micromanagement
• Multi-pollen recipes create exponential income scaling
• Visual feedback: colored pollen cubes, bee trails, delivery routes
• Clear progression path from simple single-pollen to complex synergy recipes


🎯 TARGET AUDIENCE

• Players who enjoy incremental/idle games with strategic depth
• Fans of automation and optimization puzzles
• Anyone looking for a relaxing but engaging 20-30 minute campaign experience


🛠️ TECHNICAL SHOWCASE (For Recruiters)

This prototype demonstrates professional game development practices:

**Systems Architecture:**
• Singleton manager pattern for centralized game systems
• Event-driven UI communication (decoupled, testable)
• Data-driven design via ScriptableObjects (42 configuration assets)
• Modern Unity 6 API usage (URP pipeline, new FindObjectsByType patterns)

**Code Quality:**
• Clean separation of concerns (managers, controllers, data)
• Proper component lifecycle management
• Real-time rate calculations across multiple systems
• Comprehensive XML documentation

**Design Patterns:**
• Observer pattern for UI updates
• Strategy pattern for seasonal modifiers
• Object pooling considerations for performance
• Centralized material management for visual consistency


⏱️ PLAY TIME
20-30 minutes per campaign run. High replayability - try different strategies and beat your high score!

💡 TIPS FOR BEST EXPERIENCE

• Read the "How to Play" guide (? button) before starting
• Watch production rate indicators to identify bottlenecks
• Multi-pollen recipes are exponentially more valuable than single-type
• Don't neglect capacity upgrades - they unlock more bee slots
• Each season changes the optimal strategy - adapt accordingly!


🔮 FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS (Not Implemented)

This is a complete prototype focused on core systems. If developed further, potential additions could include:
• Winter season with unique challenges
• More biome variety and recipe complexity
• Prestige/meta-progression systems
• Additional strategic depth (weather events, bee specializations)
• Audio content (music and ambient tracks)

=== COVER IMAGE SUGGESTIONS ===

Recommended screenshot elements to capture:
1. Main game view showing multiple biome regions with bees in flight
2. HUD displaying pollen inventory with colored rate indicators (green/red)
3. Recipe panel showing active honey production
4. Season UI indicating current season and modifiers

Alternative: Create a simple title card with:
- "HIVE EMPIRE" title
- Bee icon or silhouette
- Tagline: "Build Your Automated Pollen Empire"
- Minimalist aesthetic matching game's clean design


=== DEVLOG/POST IDEAS ===

Consider writing a short devlog about:
• "Designing a Global Resource Pool System in Unity"
• "Event-Driven UI Architecture for Incremental Games"
• "ScriptableObject-Based Game Balance Design"
• "Building Satisfying Automation Feedback Loops"

This demonstrates technical communication skills alongside the prototype!
