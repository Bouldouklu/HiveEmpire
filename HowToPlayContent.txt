HOW TO PLAY - HIVE EMPIRE

=== GOAL ===
Maximize your income over 3 seasons (21 weeks) by building an automated pollen delivery network.

=== CORE LOOP ===
1. UNLOCK biome regions ($) to access new pollen types
2. ALLOCATE bees to regions (Fleet Management button)
3. BEES automatically gather pollen and deliver to hive
4. RECIPES automatically produce honey from collected pollen
5. SELL honey for income to expand and upgrade

=== KEY SYSTEMS ===

BEE FLEET MANAGEMENT:
• Global bee pool - allocate bees to different regions
• More bees = faster pollen collection
• Purchase additional bees via Fleet Management panel
• Each region has a capacity limit (upgrade to increase)

BIOME REGIONS:
• Click locked regions to unlock for a cost
• Each biome produces a unique pollen type
• Upgrade capacity to assign more bees per region

RECIPES & PRODUCTION:
• Recipes automatically produce when ingredients available
• Multi-pollen recipes = exponentially higher value
• Check inventory rates to identify bottlenecks
  - Green (+X/s) = producing surplus
  - Red (-X/s) = consuming faster than gathering
• Recipes process in priority order (top to bottom)

SEASONAL MODIFIERS:
• Spring: Balanced start
• Summer: Higher income, faster bees
• Autumn: Production slowdown
• Modifiers affect income, bee speed, and production time
• Adapt your strategy each season!

=== STRATEGY TIPS ===
• Balance bee allocation - don't over-focus one pollen type
• Watch production rates - red numbers mean bottlenecks
• Unlock regions strategically based on recipe needs
• Multi-pollen recipes give best returns
• Upgrade capacity to support more bees per region
• Year ends at Week 21 - maximize income by then!

=== CONTROLS ===
• Click: Interact with regions and UI panels
• Keyboard 1: Normal speed (1x)
• Keyboard 2: Double speed (2x) - testing
• Keyboard 3: Fast forward (5x) - testing
• Mouse Hover: View tooltips on UI elements

=== UI GUIDE ===
• Top-Left: Bee count and pollen inventory with rates
• Top-Right: Current money balance
• Fleet Button: Manage global bee allocation
• Season Display: Current season, week, and modifiers
• Recipe Panel: Active recipes and production progress

Good luck building your hive empire!
