TOOLTIP SETUP GUIDE - FIXES FOR POSITIONING & MOUSE MOVEMENT

=== FIXED ISSUES ===
1. ✅ Tooltip now hides when mouse moves more than 5 pixels
2. ✅ Better positioning logic for different Canvas Render Modes
3. ✅ Proper screen-space clamping

=== UNITY SETUP ===

1. TOOLTIP PANEL SETUP:
   - Anchor: Bottom-Left (not center!)
   - Pivot: (0, 0) - This is CRITICAL for positioning
   - Position: Start at (0, 0)
   - Size: Width: 300, Height: 80 (or auto-fit to text)

2. CANVAS RENDER MODE:
   Your canvas should typically be:
   - Render Mode: Screen Space - Overlay

   If you're using Screen Space - Camera:
   - Make sure "Render Camera" is assigned
   - The script will handle it automatically now

3. TOOLTIP CONTROLLER CONFIGURATION:
   In the TooltipController component:
   - Show Delay: 0.5
   - Cursor Offset X: 15 (right of cursor)
   - Cursor Offset Y: 15 (ABOVE cursor - positive = up!)
   - Mouse Movement Threshold: 5 (how many pixels mouse can move before hiding)

   IMPORTANT OFFSET NOTES:
   - In Screen Space Overlay: Y axis goes UP from bottom
   - Positive Y = higher on screen
   - To show tooltip ABOVE cursor, use POSITIVE Y offset (like 15 or 20)
   - To show tooltip to the right, use POSITIVE X offset (like 15)

4. RECOMMENDED OFFSETS:

   For tooltip appearing above-right of cursor:
   X: 15, Y: 15

   For tooltip appearing above cursor (centered):
   X: -150 (half panel width), Y: 20

   For tooltip appearing to the right of cursor:
   X: 20, Y: 0

=== TESTING CHECKLIST ===

1. Hover over UI element with TooltipTrigger
   ✓ Wait 0.5 seconds - tooltip should appear
   ✓ Tooltip should be near cursor (offset by your configured amount)

2. Move mouse slightly (< 5 pixels)
   ✓ Tooltip should stay visible
   ✓ Tooltip should NOT follow mouse (stays at initial position)

3. Move mouse more (> 5 pixels)
   ✓ Tooltip should disappear immediately

4. Move mouse off UI element
   ✓ Tooltip should disappear immediately

=== TROUBLESHOOTING ===

PROBLEM: Tooltip appears in wrong position
SOLUTION:
- Check Canvas Render Mode (should be Screen Space Overlay)
- Check TooltipPanel Anchor is Bottom-Left
- Check TooltipPanel Pivot is (0, 0)
- Try adjusting Cursor Offset Y to positive value (10-20)

PROBLEM: Tooltip doesn't hide when mouse moves
SOLUTION:
- Check that the updated TooltipController.cs is compiled
- Adjust Mouse Movement Threshold if needed (try 10 or 15)

PROBLEM: Tooltip follows cursor constantly
SOLUTION:
- This is expected! Tooltip position updates each frame
- If you want it to stay fixed, comment out the UpdateTooltipPosition() call in Update()

PROBLEM: Tooltip position jumps around
SOLUTION:
- Make sure parentCanvas is properly assigned (should auto-detect)
- Verify Canvas Scaler settings if using
